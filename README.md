# ResponsivePortfolio

For my responsive portfolio, I went with a more direct approach to styling the page, as I am a fan of darker backgrounds with white letters.
The ultimate goal of the project was to lay the foundation for a portfolio that we will now add to as we navigate the Full Stack Web Development Course.
This was also an exercise in using Bootstrap and Bootswatch to employ high-quality, visually striking applications that can be viewed on a desktop, tablet
or mobile device. Therefore, it was also an important opportunity to gain familiarity with Bootstrap's grid system to ensure proper functionality.

## Images to Show Functionality

Below are some screen shots to show how the application looks on laptops, tablets, and mobile devices.
