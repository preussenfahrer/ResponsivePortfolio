# ResponsivePortfolio

For my responsive portfolio, I went with a more direct approach to styling the page, as I am a fan of darker backgrounds with white letters.
The ultimate goal of the project was to lay the foundation for a portfolio that we will now add to as we navigate the Full Stack Web Development Course.
This was also an exercise in using Bootstrap and Bootswatch to employ high-quality, visually striking applications that can be viewed on a desktop, tablet
or mobile device. Therefore, it was also an important opportunity to gain familiarity with Bootstrap's grid system to ensure proper functionality. The link
to the application can be found here: https://preussenfahrer.github.io/ResponsivePortfolio/.

## Images to Show Functionality

Below are some screen shots to show how the application looks on laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. You can also see how the navigation bar will go vertical when the screen is made smaller.
