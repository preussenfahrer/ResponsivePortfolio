                <p> I am a professional historian
                    who specializes in the history of the Middle Ages. I am currently a student at the University of
                    Pennsylvania's
                    Full Stack Web Development Program. I have studied in the United States and in the United Kingdom,
                    where I earned my doctorate degree in History in the summer of 2019.
                </p>
                <p>In 2019, I was a postdoctoral research assistant at the Malbork Castle Museum, in Poland,
                    in addition to serving as a part time lecturer in the department of History at Cardiff
                    University, in Wales. I have recently been awarded a postdoctoral fellowship at Nicholas Copernicus University, in Torun, Poland, to commence in September of 2021.</p> 
                    <p>My interests in coding and programming began last year, when I was exposed
                    to the impressive research conducted by medieval historians using programming languages to
                    create navigable, accessible editions of primary sources for the broader public and students to use. There is so much potential for creating new, innovative, exciting, and insightful tools for everyone.</p>
